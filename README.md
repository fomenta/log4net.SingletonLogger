# log4net.SingletonLogger

## Brief Description

log4net Singleton Logger defines a global static class for logging that depends on log4net. It avoids the cumbersome task of creating a private static logger on each class on which logging is desired. It automatically solves correct stack trace from caller. Also, its output fits external tools such as Log2Console (http://log2console.codeplex.com/)
